        description:
          "Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that explores the nature of existence, being, and reality. It seeks to answer fundamental questions about what entities exist and how they can be categorized.",
        explanation:
          "Ontology is concerned with the basic structure of reality. Aristotle classified entities into categories, distinguishing between substances and their properties. Heidegger explored the meaning of 'being' itself, arguing that modern philosophy had neglected this fundamental question. Ontology addresses issues such as whether abstract concepts (e.g., numbers, properties) exist independently or are merely mental constructs.",

        explanation:
          "Monism asserts that only one fundamental substance exists—Spinoza argued that everything is an aspect of a single divine substance. Dualism, defended by Descartes, claims that reality consists of two separate substances, mind and body. Leibniz's pluralism suggests that reality is composed of an infinite number of simple, indivisible units called 'monads.' This debate influences discussions in physics, consciousness studies, and metaphysics.",

        explanation:
          "Materialism holds that everything that exists is composed of physical matter—Democritus proposed that atoms form the basis of reality. In contrast, Idealism, championed by Berkeley, argues that reality is fundamentally mental, existing only through perception. Kant proposed a middle ground, distinguishing between 'phenomena' (things as they appear to us) and 'noumena' (things as they are in themselves).

Aristotle, in contrast, believed universals exist only in the particular things that instantiate them.

        explanation:
          "St. Augustine struggled with defining time, recognizing that while we experience its passage, its true nature remains elusive. McTaggart argued that time is an illusion, distinguishing between the 'A-series' (past, present, future) and 'B-series' (earlier/later relations). Einstein revolutionized the discussion with his theory of relativity, showing that time is relative to the observer’s frame of reference. These ideas challenge our everyday understanding of time.",

        explanation:
          "Aristotle proposed four types of causes: material, formal, efficient, and final causes, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding change. Hume challenged traditional views, arguing that causation is not an objective feature of reality but a habitual expectation formed by human minds. Kant attempted to reconcile these views, asserting that causality is a necessary condition imposed by human cognition on experience.

In a world dominated by media, advertisements, and consumer culture, people can no longer distinguish the real from the artificial, and we live in a constant state of hyperreality.",

These power structures define what is considered true or false, normal or abnormal, and thus shape social reality.
